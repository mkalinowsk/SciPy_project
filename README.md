## “Scientific Programming in Python” 
Description of our project 

#### Topic 
Wine comparison

#### Goal of our project
Analyze and evaluate data about wine reviews 

#### About the Dataset
It contains about 130.000 wine reviews. With several information about each wine like the price, variety, region, country etc. Each wine was tested by different wine testers who scored each wine. We downloaded the dataset from ‘Kaggle’.

#### Main Questions
Does the average price of the wine correlate with the points (given by the wine taster)?\
Which country has the highest average price? What about those that have at least 10 wines?\
Do appraisers tend to specialize in one or two provinces? Do they specialize in certain varieties?\ 
Do certain characteristic words appear more often in the ratings than others? Does this have anything to do with origin, variety or points of the wine?

#### Used libraries
pandas\
numpy \
matplotlib\
vega_datasets\
ipywidgets

#### Installation 
The dataset is as an .zip folder in wine_analysis. Unlock the zip file. Keep in mind to check pd.read_csv("<your_path>").

Have fun,\
